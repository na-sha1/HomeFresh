            <h1><a href="#birria-tacos"> The best <em><a href="https://www.vallartaeats.com/birria-taco-origins/">birria tacos</a> </em> dipped in the stew and then fried to crispy gloriousness</a></h1>

                It’s really in dipping the tortilla into the stew and frying it to a crisp that the magic happens, so don’t skip this step.
                Tacos are good but very few people who don’t live in the southwest know that tacos only become truly transcendent once you
                cook the tortilla in fat.
                    Traditionally they do this in butter or lard, but here we use the fat from the top of the stew to give it
                that extra kick. Once you bite into a crisp fried taco shell, you’ll never go back.

            <h3>Birria Ingredients</h3>
            <p>
                The best cut of beef for birria tacos. For the ultimate birria tacos, use a good beef shank. This is non-negotiable.
                 You can, and should, mix up another cut as well for texture and variety. I prefer meat that’s a little on the lean
                 side for tacos, so I mixed it up with a cheap roast like cab sirloin, but if Steph had her way, she would use short
                 ribs. But, since she’s not cooking, we ended up with a cab sirloin.<br><br>

                      <strong>Dried Guajillo Peppers.</strong> These sun dried peppers add an authentic touch of mexican flavor to any stew and you
                      can usually find them in the Mexican aisle of your local grocery store (if you live in America). They are like
                      a mild-medium pepper and don’t add any heat, so you don’t have to worry at all. If you can’t find them, sub
                      any dried mexican/southwestern peppers you can find, such as ancho, new mexico, california, or pasilla. If you
                      really can’t find them, you can skip them, but they’re worth looking for!<br>

                      <strong>Chipotle peppers in adobo.</strong> These come in a little can and they are salty-sweet-spicy delicious. They form the base of many mexican
                      stews and marinades and you can find them pretty much everywhere in the world, they’re that good. We usually keep 3-4 cans around
                      just for tacos al pastor.<br>

                      <strong>Mexican oregano.</strong>This version of oregano is always cheaper and almost always fresher and better than the spice aisle stuff, so
                      if you’re already in the Mexican aisle, be sure to pick up a bag, usually only 99 cents or so.
